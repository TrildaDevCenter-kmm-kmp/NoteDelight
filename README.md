Migrated to [SQLDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight) from [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) Persistence Library.

## WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸ› 
We need an iOS developer. If you have the skill to create apps with SwiftUI and are enthusiastic to contribute to open source, you can pull-request and/or [contact me](https://t.me/Archi_bald) for a collaboration experience.

We are also working on shared code for the multi-platform module.
