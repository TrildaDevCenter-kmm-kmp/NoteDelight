Partially deprecated, will be updated soon.

## WORK IN PROGRESS üõ†

We need an iOS developer. If you have the skill to create apps with SwiftUI and are enthusiastic to
contribute to open source, you can pull-request and/or [contact me](https://t.me/Archi_bald) for a
collaboration experience.

We are also working on shared code for the multi-platform module.

## HISTORY üìú

fork of [NoteCrypt](https://github.com/softartdev/NoteCrypt)).

Migrated to [SQLDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight)
from [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) Persistence Library.
